# Plan Feature Implementation Progress Tracker

Branch: `feat/plan-feature-synced-20250605` (Updated from `feat/plan-feature`)

---

## Phase 1: Core Infrastructure & Entities

**[✓] Step 1: Setup `@nestjs/microservices` (Redis Transporter for Events & RPC)**
    - Installed `@nestjs/microservices` (using `--legacy-peer-deps` due to v10/v11 conflict).
    - Modified `main.ts` to connect Redis transport listener & start microservices.
    - Created basic `plan` module structure (`plan.module.ts`, `plan.controller.ts`, `plan.service.ts`).
    - Configured `ClientsModule` in `PlanModule` for `PLAN_EVENTS_SERVICE`.
    - Configured `ClientsModule` in `VenueModule` for `PLAN_SERVICE_RPC`.
    - Imported `PlanModule` into `AppModule`.
    - *Verification:* Application successfully starts and maps `PlanController` routes.

    Issues/Challenges:
The --legacy-peer-deps flag usage for installing @nestjs/microservices remains a point of technical debt to address later, ideally by upgrading all NestJS packages to v11. No immediate blockers.

**[✓] Step 2: Create/Update Entities**
    - Created `plan/entities/city.entity.ts` (with `imageUrl`, PostGIS `location`).
    - Created `plan/entities/plan.entity.ts` (with relation to `City`).
    - Created `plan/entities/plan-user.entity.ts` (with relation to `Plan`, composite index).
    - Updated `venue/entities/venue.entity.ts` (added `cityId` field and index).
    - Updated `event/entities/event.entity.ts` (added `cityId` field and index).

**[✓] Step 3: Database Migrations**
    - Ran `node ./node_modules/typeorm/cli.js migration:generate ...` to create migration file.
    - Generated `...-AddPlanCityVenueEventSchemas.ts`.
    - **Inspected:** Verified creation of `cities`, `plans`, `plan_users` tables, addition of `city_id` to `venues`/`events`, and presence of correct columns, types, indexes (incl. spatial), and FKs.
    - **Note:** Migration also included necessary schema updates for `venues.location` (from Geo Hashing TDL) and `user_profiles_gender_enum` (due to entity changes), aligning DB with current entity definitions.

**[✓] Step 4: Dynamic City Creation & Optional Seeding**
    - Acknowledged dynamic creation as primary mechanism (Phase 2).
    - Created `plan/seeders/city.seeder.service.ts` with `seedFromFile` method structure.
    - Included placeholder logic for reading JSON/CSV and calling `CityRepository` (dependency on Phase 2).
    - Added `CitySeederService` to `PlanModule` providers/exports.
    - **Note:** Seeder service cannot be fully run/tested until `CityRepository` is implemented.

---

## Phase 2: Repositories & Core Services

**[✓] Step 5: Create/Update Repositories**
    - Created `plan/repositories/city.repository.ts` with required methods (incl. `findOrCreateByNameAndCountry` emitting `city.created`).
    - Created `plan/repositories/plan.repository.ts` with required methods.
    - Created `plan/repositories/plan-user.repository.ts` with required methods.
    - Updated `PlanModule` providers and added `TypeOrmModule.forFeature`.
    - Analyzed `VenueRepository` & `EventRepository`: Confirmed existing `create`/`update`/`save` methods can handle `cityId` via partial entity/DTO argument; no internal repository changes needed for the field itself.
    - *Verification:* TS error in `CitySeederService` related to `CityRepository` import should now be resolved.

**[✓] Step 6: Core Services Implementation & Communication**
    - Enhanced `GoogleMapsService` with `reverseGeocode` method.
    - Implemented `PlanService` with `createPlan` (incl. city resolution) and other methods, emitting events.
    - Implemented `CityService` with `@MessagePattern('city.findOrCreate')` RPC handler.
    - Implemented `CityImageService` with `@EventPattern('city.created')` handler for async image fetching.
    - Modified `VenueScanConsumer` to use RPC for `city.findOrCreate`.
    - Added `POST /user/location` endpoint to `UserController` for login trigger.
    - Added `@MessagePattern('venue.triggerScanIfStale')` handler to `VenueService` and implemented `enqueueScanIfStale` logic.
    - Updated `PlanModule`, `UserModule`, `VenueModule` providers/imports/exports.
    - **Note:** Requires testing for async flows, RPC communication, error handling, and idempotency.
    - **Issue:** Persistent `AxiosError` import issue in `GoogleMapsService` flagged by linter (likely tooling/env issue).

**[✓] Step 7: Inter-Service Communication (Payloads & Patterns)**
    - Created `plan/dto/plan-communication.dto.ts` with `BaseEventPayload` and specific Plan event interfaces (`PlanCreatedPayload`, etc.).
    - Created `plan/dto/city-communication.dto.ts` with `CityCreatedPayload` and `FindOrCreateCityRpc` namespace (Request/Response/Pattern).
    - Created `venue/dto/venue-communication.dto.ts` with `TriggerScanIfStaleRpc` namespace (Request/Response/Pattern).
    - Added comments explaining usage.

**[✓] Step 8: Scheduled Tasks (`CityTrendingJob`)**
    - Added `ScheduleModule.forRoot()` to `PlanModule`.
    - Created `plan/jobs/city-trending.job.ts`.
    - Implemented `CityTrendingJob` class with `@Cron(CronExpression.EVERY_DAY_AT_3AM)`.
    - Injected `CityRepository` and added basic logic to fetch cities and update `trendingScore` based on `planCount`.
    - Included basic error handling and overlap prevention.
    - Added `CityTrendingJob` to `PlanModule` providers.

    Issues: The current findAll implementation in the job fetches all cities at once. This might become inefficient for very large numbers of cities. Future optimization could involve batching or querying only recently active cities. (Noted in code TODO).

**[✓] Step 9: API Endpoints & Aggregation**
    - Configured `CacheModule` with `cache-manager-redis-yet` in `PlanModule`.
    - Defined `TrendingCityDto` and `CityDetailsDto` in `plan/dto/city-response.dto.ts`.
    - Implemented `GET /cities/trending` endpoint in `CityController` with caching.
    - Implemented `GET /cities/:cityId/details` endpoint in `CityController` with caching (aggregation deferred).
    - Added Swagger decorators.

**[✓] Step 10: Backfill Jobs**
    - Created `venue-backfill.dto.ts` and `event-backfill.dto.ts` for RPC communication.
    - Added `findWithoutCityId` and `updateCityId` methods to `VenueRepository` and `EventRepository`.
    - Added corresponding service methods and `@MessagePattern` handlers to `VenueService` and `EventService`.
    - Added `VenueCityBackfillJob` and `EventCityBackfillJob` in `plan` service.
    - Jobs fetch entities via RPC, use `GoogleMapsService` for reverse geocoding, call `city.findOrCreate` via RPC, and update entities via RPC.
    - Included basic rate limiting and error handling per record.
    - Added `AdminBackfillController` with `POST /admin/backfill/venues` and `POST /admin/backfill/events` endpoints (Admin role required) to trigger jobs.
    - Configured `ClientsModule` in `PlanModule` for `VENUE_SERVICE_RPC` and `EVENT_SERVICE_RPC`.
    - Added jobs and admin controller to `PlanModule`.
